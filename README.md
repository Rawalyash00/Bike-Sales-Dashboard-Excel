# Excel-Bike-Sales-Dashboard
The focal point of this project is to create an Excel dashboard to analyze bike sales data, aiming to gain insights into sales performance across different products, regions, and time periods. The primary goal is to explore various factors influencing bike sales, such as product popularity, pricing strategies, marketing campaigns, and seasonal trends. Through this analysis, we seek to identify key patterns, correlations, and opportunities for optimization in sales strategies and inventory management. The dataset utilized for this Excel dashboard is sourced from sales records tracking bike sales, including product details, sales volume, revenue, and customer demographics.
